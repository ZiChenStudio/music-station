# Music Station

[ENGLISH](README-en.md)|[简体中文](README-zh.md)

## Brief introduction

This code implements a simple web application of a music player that starts playing music at the click of a button and displays a list of the music and the total duration.

The specific playing logic is based on the current time to determine whether to skip the already played music and automatically switch to the next one.

## Why did I create this project?

I wanted to make a music station to listen to songs, but it required hardware for other people to receive the music, so I used front-end technology.
